# Tutorial 1: Learn about Configs

We incorporate modular and inheritance design into our config system, which is convenient to conduct various experiments.
If you wish to inspect the config file, you may run `python tools/misc/print_config.py /PATH/TO/CONFIG` to see the complete config.

## Modify config through script arguments

When submitting jobs using "tools/train.py" or "tools/test.py", you may specify `--cfg-options` to in-place modify the config.

- Update config keys of dict chains.

  The config options can be specified following the order of the dict keys in the original config.
  For example, `--cfg-options model.backbone.norm_eval=False` changes the all BN modules in model backbones to `train` mode.

- Update keys inside a list of configs.

  Some config dicts are composed as a list in your config. For example, the training pipeline `data.train.pipeline` is normally a list
  e.g. `[dict(type='LoadImageFromFile'), ...]`. If you want to change `'LoadImageFromFile'` to `'LoadImageFromWebcam'` in the pipeline,
  you may specify `--cfg-options data.train.pipeline.0.type=LoadImageFromWebcam`.

- Update values of list/tuples.

  If the value to be updated is a list or a tuple. For example, the config file normally sets `workflow=[('train', 1)]`. If you want to
  change this key, you may specify `--cfg-options workflow="[(train,1),(val,1)]"`. Note that the quotation mark \" is necessary to
  support list/tuple data types, and that **NO** white space is allowed inside the quotation marks in the specified value.

## Config File Structure

There are 4 basic component types under `config/_base_`, dataset, model, schedule, default_runtime.
Many methods could be easily constructed with one of each like Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, Cascade R-CNN, RPN, SSD.
The configs that are composed by components from `_base_` are called _primitive_.

For all configs under the same folder, it is recommended to have only **one** _primitive_ config. All other configs should inherit from the _primitive_ config. In this way, the maximum of inheritance level is 3.

For easy understanding, we recommend contributors to inherit from exiting methods.
For example, if some modification is made base on Faster R-CNN, user may first inherit the basic Faster R-CNN structure by specifying `_base_ = ../faster_rcnn/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py`, then modify the necessary fields in the config files.

If you are building an entirely new method that does not share the structure with any of the existing methods, you may create a folder `xxx_rcnn` under `configs`,

Please refer to [mmcv](https://mmcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/utils.html#config) for detailed documentation.

## Config Name Style

We follow the below style to name config files. Contributors are advised to follow the same style.

```
{model}_[model setting]_{backbone}_{neck}_[norm setting]_[misc]_[gpu x batch_per_gpu]_{schedule}_{dataset}
```

`{xxx}` is required field and `[yyy]` is optional.

- `{model}`: model type like `faster_rcnn`, `mask_rcnn`, etc.
- `[model setting]`: specific setting for some model, like `without_semantic` for `htc`, `moment` for `reppoints`, etc.
- `{backbone}`: backbone type like `r50` (ResNet-50), `x101` (ResNeXt-101).
- `{neck}`: neck type like `fpn`, `pafpn`, `nasfpn`, `c4`.
- `[norm_setting]`: `bn` (Batch Normalization) is used unless specified, other norm layer type could be `gn` (Group Normalization), `syncbn` (Synchronized Batch Normalization).
    `gn-head`/`gn-neck` indicates GN is applied in head/neck only, while `gn-all` means GN is applied in the entire model, e.g. backbone, neck, head.
- `[misc]`: miscellaneous setting/plugins of model, e.g. `dconv`, `gcb`, `attention`, `albu`, `mstrain`.
- `[gpu x batch_per_gpu]`: GPUs and samples per GPU, `8x2` is used by default.
- `{schedule}`: training schedule, options are `1x`, `2x`, `20e`, etc.
    `1x` and `2x` means 12 epochs and 24 epochs respectively.
    `20e` is adopted in cascade models, which denotes 20 epochs.
    For `1x`/`2x`, initial learning rate decays by a factor of 10 at the 8/16th and 11/22th epochs.
    For `20e`, initial learning rate decays by a factor of 10 at the 16th and 19th epochs.
- `{dataset}`: dataset like `coco`, `cityscapes`, `voc_0712`, `wider_face`.

## Deprecated train_cfg/test_cfg

The `train_cfg` and `test_cfg` are deprecated in config file, please specify them in the model config. The original config structure is as below.

```python
# deprecated
model = dict(
   type=...,
   ...
)
train_cfg=dict(...)
test_cfg=dict(...)
```

The migration example is as below.

```python
# recommended
model = dict(
   type=...,
   ...
   train_cfg=dict(...),
   test_cfg=dict(...),
)
```

## An Example of Mask R-CNN

To help the users have a basic idea of a complete config and the modules in a modern detection system,
we make brief comments on the config of Mask R-CNN using ResNet50 and FPN as the following.

## FAQ

### Ignore some fields in the base configs

Sometimes, you may set `_delete_=True` to ignore some of fields in base configs.
You may refer to [mmcv](https://mmcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/utils.html#inherit-from-base-config-with-ignored-fields) for simple inllustration.

In MMDetection, for example, to change the backbone of Mask R-CNN with the following config.

```python
model = dict(
    type='MaskRCNN',
    pretrained='torchvision://resnet50',
    backbone=dict(
        type='ResNet',
        depth=50,
        num_stages=4,
        out_indices=(0, 1, 2, 3),
        frozen_stages=1,
        norm_cfg=dict(type='BN', requires_grad=True),
        norm_eval=True,
        style='pytorch'),
    neck=dict(...),
    rpn_head=dict(...),
    roi_head=dict(...))
```

`ResNet` and `HRNet` use different keywords to construct.

```python
_base_ = '../mask_rcnn/mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py'
model = dict(
    pretrained='open-mmlab://msra/hrnetv2_w32',
    backbone=dict(
        _delete_=True,
        type='HRNet',
        extra=dict(
            stage1=dict(
                num_modules=1,
                num_branches=1,
                block='BOTTLENECK',
                num_blocks=(4, ),
                num_channels=(64, )),
            stage2=dict(
                num_modules=1,
                num_branches=2,
                block='BASIC',
                num_blocks=(4, 4),
                num_channels=(32, 64)),
            stage3=dict(
                num_modules=4,
                num_branches=3,
                block='BASIC',
                num_blocks=(4, 4, 4),
                num_channels=(32, 64, 128)),
            stage4=dict(
                num_modules=3,
                num_branches=4,
                block='BASIC',
                num_blocks=(4, 4, 4, 4),
                num_channels=(32, 64, 128, 256)))),
    neck=dict(...))
```

The `_delete_=True` would replace all old keys in `backbone` field with new keys.

### Use intermediate variables in configs

Some intermediate variables are used in the configs files, like `train_pipeline`/`test_pipeline` in datasets.
It's worth noting that when modifying intermediate variables in the children configs, user need to pass the intermediate variables into corresponding fields again.
For example, we would like to use multi scale strategy to train a Mask R-CNN. `train_pipeline`/`test_pipeline` are intermediate variable we would like modify.

```python
_base_ = './mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py'
img_norm_cfg = dict(
    mean=[123.675, 116.28, 103.53], std=[58.395, 57.12, 57.375], to_rgb=True)
train_pipeline = [
    dict(type='LoadImageFromFile'),
    dict(type='LoadAnnotations', with_bbox=True, with_mask=True),
    dict(
        type='Resize',
        img_scale=[(1333, 640), (1333, 672), (1333, 704), (1333, 736),
                   (1333, 768), (1333, 800)],
        multiscale_mode="value",
        keep_ratio=True),
    dict(type='RandomFlip', flip_ratio=0.5),
    dict(type='Normalize', **img_norm_cfg),
    dict(type='Pad', size_divisor=32),
    dict(type='DefaultFormatBundle'),
    dict(type='Collect', keys=['img', 'gt_bboxes', 'gt_labels', 'gt_masks']),
]
test_pipeline = [
    dict(type='LoadImageFromFile'),
    dict(
        type='MultiScaleFlipAug',
        img_scale=(1333, 800),
        flip=False,
        transforms=[
            dict(type='Resize', keep_ratio=True),
            dict(type='RandomFlip'),
            dict(type='Normalize', **img_norm_cfg),
            dict(type='Pad', size_divisor=32),
            dict(type='ImageToTensor', keys=['img']),
            dict(type='Collect', keys=['img']),
        ])
]
data = dict(
    train=dict(pipeline=train_pipeline),
    val=dict(pipeline=test_pipeline),
    test=dict(pipeline=test_pipeline))
```

We first define the new `train_pipeline`/`test_pipeline` and pass them into `data`.
