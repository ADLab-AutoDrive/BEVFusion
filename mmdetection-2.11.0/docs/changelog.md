#### Backwards Incompatible Changes

**FP16 related methods are imported from mmcv instead of mmdet. (#3766, #3822)**
Mixed precision training utils in `mmdet.core.fp16` are moved to `mmcv.runner`, including `force_fp32`, `auto_fp16`, `wrap_fp16_model`, and `Fp16OptimizerHook`. A deprecation warning will be raised if users attempt to import those methods from `mmdet.core.fp16`, and will be finally removed in V2.10.0.

**[0, N-1] represents foreground classes and N indicates background classes for all models. (#3221)**
Before v2.5.0, the background label for RPN is 0, and N for other heads. Now the behavior is consistent for all models. Thus `self.background_labels` in `dense_heads` is removed and all heads use `self.num_classes` to indicate the class index of background labels.
This change has no effect on the pre-trained models in the v2.x model zoo, but will affect the training of all models with RPN heads. Two-stage detectors whose RPN head uses softmax will be affected because the order of categories is changed.

**Only call `get_subset_by_classes` when `test_mode=True` and `self.filter_empty_gt=True` (#3695)**
Function `get_subset_by_classes` in dataset is refactored and only filters out images when `test_mode=True` and `self.filter_empty_gt=True`.
    In the original implementation, `get_subset_by_classes` is not related to the flag `self.filter_empty_gt` and will only be called when the classes is set during initialization no matter `test_mode` is `True` or `False`. This brings ambiguous behavior and potential bugs in many cases. After v2.5.0, if `filter_empty_gt=False`, no matter whether the classes are specified in a dataset, the dataset will use all the images in the annotations. If `filter_empty_gt=True` and `test_mode=True`, no matter whether the classes are specified, the dataset will call ``get_subset_by_classes` to check the images and filter out images containing no GT boxes. Therefore, the users should be responsible for the data filtering/cleaning process for the test dataset.

#### New Features

- Test time augmentation for single stage detectors (#3844, #3638)
- Support to show the name of experiments during training (#3764)
- Add `Shear`, `Rotate`, `Translate` Augmentation (#3656, #3619, #3687)

### v2.4.0 (5/9/2020)

**Highlights**

- Support Batch Inference
- Start to publish `mmdet` package to PyPI since v2.3.0
- Switch model zoo to download.openmmlab.com

**Backwards Incompatible Changes**

- Support Batch Inference (#3564, #3686, #3705): Since v2.4.0, MMDetection could inference model with multiple images in a single GPU.
  This change influences all the test APIs in MMDetection and downstream codebases. To help the users migrate their code, we use `replace_ImageToTensor` (#3686) to convert legacy test data pipelines during dataset initialization.
- Support RandomFlip with horizontal/vertical/diagonal direction (#3608): Since v2.4.0, MMDetection supports horizontal/vertical/diagonal flip in the data augmentation. This influences bounding box, mask, and image transformations in data augmentation process and the process that will map those data back to the original format.
- Migrate to use `mmlvis` and `mmpycocotools` for COCO and LVIS dataset (#3727). The APIs are fully compatible with the original `lvis` and `pycocotools`. Users need to uninstall the existing pycocotools and lvis packages in their environment first and install `mmlvis` & `mmpycocotools`.

### v2.0.0 (6/5/2020)

In this release, we made lots of major refactoring and modifications.

1. **Faster speed**. We optimize the training and inference speed for common models, achieving up to 30% speedup for training and 25% for inference. Please refer to [model zoo](model_zoo.md#comparison-with-detectron2) for details.

2. **Higher performance**. We change some default hyperparameters with no additional cost, which leads to a gain of performance for most models. Please refer to [compatibility](compatibility.md#training-hyperparameters) for details.

3. **More documentation and tutorials**. We add a bunch of documentation and tutorials to help users get started more smoothly. Read it [here](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

4. **Support PyTorch 1.5**. The support for 1.1 and 1.2 is dropped, and we switch to some new APIs.

5. **Better configuration system**. Inheritance is supported to reduce the redundancy of configs.

6. **Better modular design**. Towards the goal of simplicity and flexibility, we simplify some encapsulation while add more other configurable modules like BBoxCoder, IoUCalculator, OptimizerConstructor, RoIHead. Target computation is also included in heads and the call hierarchy is simpler.

7. Support new methods: [FSAF](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00621) and PAFPN (part of [PAFPN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01534)).
