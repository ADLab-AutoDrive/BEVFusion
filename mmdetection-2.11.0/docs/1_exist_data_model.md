# 1: Inference and train with existing models and standard datasets

MMDetection provides hundreds of existing and existing detection models in [Model Zoo](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/model_zoo.html)), and supports multiple standard datasets, including Pascal VOC, COCO, CityScapes, LVIS, etc. This note will show how to perform common tasks on these existing models and standard datasets, including:

- Use existing models to inference on given images.
- Test existing models on standard datasets.
- Train predefined models on standard datasets.

## Inference with existing models

By inference, we mean using trained models to detect objects on images. In MMDetection, a model is defined by a configuration file and existing model parameters are save in a checkpoint file.

To start with, we recommend [Faster RCNN](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/master/configs/faster_rcnn) with this [configuration file](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/configs/faster_rcnn/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py) and this [checkpoint file](http://download.openmmlab.com/mmdetection/v2.0/faster_rcnn/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco_20200130-047c8118.pth). It is recommended to download the checkpoint file to `checkpoints` directory.

### High-level APIs for inference

MMDetection provide high-level Python APIs for inference on images. Here is an example of building the model and inference on given images or videos.

```python
from mmdet.apis import init_detector, inference_detector
import mmcv

# Specify the path to model config and checkpoint file
config_file = 'configs/faster_rcnn/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py'
checkpoint_file = 'checkpoints/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco_20200130-047c8118.pth'

# build the model from a config file and a checkpoint file
model = init_detector(config_file, checkpoint_file, device='cuda:0')

# test a single image and show the results
img = 'test.jpg'  # or img = mmcv.imread(img), which will only load it once
result = inference_detector(model, img)
# visualize the results in a new window
model.show_result(img, result)
# or save the visualization results to image files
model.show_result(img, result, out_file='result.jpg')

# test a video and show the results
video = mmcv.VideoReader('video.mp4')
for frame in video:
    result = inference_detector(model, frame)
    model.show_result(frame, result, wait_time=1)
```

A notebook demo can be found in [demo/inference_demo.ipynb](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/demo/inference_demo.ipynb).

Note:  `inference_detector` only supports single-image inference for now.

### Asynchronous interface - supported for Python 3.7+

For Python 3.7+, MMDetection also supports async interfaces.
By utilizing CUDA streams, it allows not to block CPU on GPU bound inference code and enables better CPU/GPU utilization for single-threaded application. Inference can be done concurrently either between different input data samples or between different models of some inference pipeline.

See `tests/async_benchmark.py` to compare the speed of synchronous and asynchronous interfaces.

```python
import asyncio
import torch
from mmdet.apis import init_detector, async_inference_detector
from mmdet.utils.contextmanagers import concurrent

async def main():
    config_file = 'configs/faster_rcnn/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py'
    checkpoint_file = 'checkpoints/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco_20200130-047c8118.pth'
    device = 'cuda:0'
    model = init_detector(config_file, checkpoint=checkpoint_file, device=device)

    # queue is used for concurrent inference of multiple images
    streamqueue = asyncio.Queue()
    # queue size defines concurrency level
    streamqueue_size = 3

    for _ in range(streamqueue_size):
        streamqueue.put_nowait(torch.cuda.Stream(device=device))

    # test a single image and show the results
    img = 'test.jpg'  # or img = mmcv.imread(img), which will only load it once

    async with concurrent(streamqueue):
        result = await async_inference_detector(model, img)

    # visualize the results in a new window
    model.show_result(img, result)
    # or save the visualization results to image files
    model.show_result(img, result, out_file='result.jpg')


asyncio.run(main())

```

### Demos

We also provide three demo scripts, implemented with high-level APIs and supporting functionality codes.
Source codes are available [here](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/master/demo).

    --out result.mp4
```

## Test existing models on standard datasets

To evaluate a model's accuracy, one usually tests the model on some standard datasets.
MMDetection supports multiple public datasets including COCO, Pascal VOC, CityScapes, and [more](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/master/configs/_base_/datasets).
This section will show how to test existing models on supported datasets.

### Prepare datasets

Public datasets like [Pascal VOC](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/index.html) or mirror and [COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#download) are available from official websites or mirrors. Note: In the detection task, Pascal VOC 2012 is an extension of Pascal VOC 2007 without overlap, and we usually use them together.
It is recommended to download and extract the dataset somewhere outside the project directory and symlink the dataset root to `$MMDETECTION/data` as below.
If your folder structure is different, you may need to change the corresponding paths in config files.

```plain
mmdetection
├── mmdet
├── tools
├── configs
├── data
│   ├── coco
│   │   ├── annotations
│   │   ├── train2017
│   │   ├── val2017
│   │   ├── test2017
│   ├── cityscapes
│   │   ├── annotations
│   │   ├── leftImg8bit
│   │   │   ├── train
│   │   │   ├── val
│   │   ├── gtFine
│   │   │   ├── train
│   │   │   ├── val
│   ├── VOCdevkit
│   │   ├── VOC2007
│   │   ├── VOC2012
```

Some models require additional [COCO-stuff](http://calvin.inf.ed.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/data/cocostuffdataset/stuffthingmaps_trainval2017.zip) datasets, such as HTC, DetectoRS and SCNet, you can download and unzip then move to the coco folder. The directory should be like this.

```plain
mmdetection
├── data
│   ├── coco
│   │   ├── annotations
│   │   ├── train2017
│   │   ├── val2017
│   │   ├── test2017
│   │   ├── stuffthingmaps
```

The [cityscapes](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/) annotations need to be converted into the coco format using `tools/dataset_converters/cityscapes.py`:

```shell
pip install cityscapesscripts

python tools/dataset_converters/cityscapes.py \
    ./data/cityscapes \
    --nproc 8 \
    --out-dir ./data/cityscapes/annotations
```

TODO: CHANGE TO THE NEW PATH

### Test existing models

We provide testing scripts for evaluating an existing model on the whole dataset (COCO, PASCAL VOC, Cityscapes, etc.).
The following testing environments are supported:

- single GPU
- single node multiple GPUs
- multiple nodes

Choose the proper script to perform testing depending on the testing environment.

```shell
# single-gpu testing
python tools/test.py \
    ${CONFIG_FILE} \
    ${CHECKPOINT_FILE} \
    [--out ${RESULT_FILE}] \
    [--eval ${EVAL_METRICS}] \
    [--show]

# multi-gpu testing
bash tools/dist_test.sh \
    ${CONFIG_FILE} \
    ${CHECKPOINT_FILE} \
    ${GPU_NUM} \
    [--out ${RESULT_FILE}] \
    [--eval ${EVAL_METRICS}]
```

`tools/dist_test.sh` also supports multi-node testing, but relies on PyTorch's [launch utility](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html#launch-utility).

Optional arguments:

- `RESULT_FILE`: Filename of the output results in pickle format. If not specified, the results will not be saved to a file.
- `EVAL_METRICS`: Items to be evaluated on the results. Allowed values depend on the dataset, e.g., `proposal_fast`, `proposal`, `bbox`, `segm` are available for COCO, `mAP`, `recall` for PASCAL VOC. Cityscapes could be evaluated by `cityscapes` as well as all COCO metrics.
- `--show`: If specified, detection results will be plotted on the images and shown in a new window. It is only applicable to single GPU testing and used for debugging and visualization. Please make sure that GUI is available in your environment. Otherwise, you may encounter an error like `cannot connect to X server`.
- `--show-dir`: If specified, detection results will be plotted on the images and saved to the specified directory. It is only applicable to single GPU testing and used for debugging and visualization. You do NOT need a GUI available in your environment for using this option.
- `--show-score-thr`: If specified, detections with scores below this threshold will be removed.
- `--cfg-options`:  if specified, the key-value pair optional cfg will be merged into config file
- `--eval-options`: if specified, the key-value pair optional eval cfg will be kwargs for dataset.evaluate() function, it's only for evaluation

### Examples

Assume that you have already downloaded the checkpoints to the directory `checkpoints/`.

1. Test Faster R-CNN and visualize the results. Press any key for the next image.
   Config and checkpoint files are available [here](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/master/configs/faster_rcnn).

   ```shell
   python tools/test.py \
       configs/faster_rcnn/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py \

       configs/faster_rcnn/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x.py \
       checkpoints/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco_20200130-047c8118.pth \
       --show-dir faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_results
   ```

3. Test Faster R-CNN on PASCAL VOC (without saving the test results) and evaluate the mAP.
   Config and checkpoint files are available [here](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/master/configs/pascal_voc).

   ```shell
   python tools/test.py \
       configs/pascal_voc/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_voc.py \
       checkpoints/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_voc0712_20200624-c9895d40.pth \
       --eval mAP
   ```

4. Test Mask R-CNN with 8 GPUs, and evaluate the bbox and mask AP.
   Config and checkpoint files are available [here](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/master/configs/mask_rcnn).

   ```shell
   ./tools/dist_test.sh \
       configs/mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py \
       checkpoints/mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco_20200205-d4b0c5d6.pth \
       8 \
       --out results.pkl \
       --eval bbox segm
   ```

5. Test Mask R-CNN with 8 GPUs, and evaluate the **classwise** bbox and mask AP.
   Config and checkpoint files are available [here](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/master/configs/mask_rcnn).

   ```shell
   ./tools/dist_test.sh \
       configs/mask_rcnn/mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py \
       checkpoints/mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco_20200205-d4b0c5d6.pth \
       8 \
       --out results.pkl \
       --eval bbox segm \
       --options "classwise=True"
   ```

6. Test Mask R-CNN on COCO test-dev with 8 GPUs, and generate JSON files for submitting to the official evaluation server.
   Config and checkpoint files are available [here](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/master/configs/mask_rcnn).

   ```shell
   ./tools/dist_test.sh \
       configs/mask_rcnn/mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py \
       checkpoints/mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco_20200205-d4b0c5d6.pth \
       8 \
       --format-only \
       --options "jsonfile_prefix=./mask_rcnn_test-dev_results"
   ```

   This command generates two JSON files `mask_rcnn_test-dev_results.bbox.json` and `mask_rcnn_test-dev_results.segm.json`.

7. Test Mask R-CNN on Cityscapes test with 8 GPUs, and generate txt and png files for submitting to the official evaluation server.
   Config and checkpoint files are available [here](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/master/configs/cityscapes).

   ```shell
   ./tools/dist_test.sh \
       configs/cityscapes/mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_cityscapes.py \
       checkpoints/mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_cityscapes_20200227-afe51d5a.pth \
       8 \
       --format-only \
       --options "txtfile_prefix=./mask_rcnn_cityscapes_test_results"
   ```

   The generated png and txt would be under `./mask_rcnn_cityscapes_test_results` directory.

### Test without Ground Truth Annotations

MMDetection supports to test models without ground-truth annotations using `CocoDataset`. If your dataset format is not in COCO format, please convert them to COCO format. For example, if your dataset format is VOC, you can directly convert it to COCO format by the [script in tools.](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/master/tools/dataset_converters/pascal_voc.py)

```shell
# single-gpu testing
python tools/test.py \
    ${CONFIG_FILE} \
    ${CHECKPOINT_FILE} \
    --format-only \
    --options ${JSONFILE_PREFIX} \
    [--show]

# multi-gpu testing
bash tools/dist_test.sh \
    ${CONFIG_FILE} \
    ${CHECKPOINT_FILE} \
    ${GPU_NUM} \
    --format-only \
    --options ${JSONFILE_PREFIX} \
    [--show]
```

Assuming that the checkpoints in the [model zoo](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modelzoo_statistics.html) have been downloaded to the directory `checkpoints/`, we can test Mask R-CNN on COCO test-dev with 8 GPUs, and generate JSON files using the following command.

```sh
./tools/dist_test.sh \
    configs/mask_rcnn/mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py \
    checkpoints/mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco_20200205-d4b0c5d6.pth \
    8 \
    -format-only \
    --options "jsonfile_prefix=./mask_rcnn_test-dev_results"
```

This command generates two JSON files `mask_rcnn_test-dev_results.bbox.json` and `mask_rcnn_test-dev_results.segm.json`.

### Batch Inference

MMDetection supports inference with a single image or batched images in test mode. By default, we use single-image inference and you can use batch inference by modifying `samples_per_gpu` in the config of test data. You can do that either by modifying the config as below.

```shell
data = dict(train=dict(...), val=dict(...), test=dict(samples_per_gpu=2, ...))
```

Or you can set it through `--cfg-options` as `--cfg-options data.test.samples_per_gpu=2`

### Deprecated ImageToTensor

In test mode,  `ImageToTensor`  pipeline is deprecated, it's replaced by `DefaultFormatBundle` that recommended to manually replace it in the test data pipeline in your config file.  examples:

```python
# use ImageToTensor (deprecated)
pipelines = [
   dict(type='LoadImageFromFile'),
   dict(
       type='MultiScaleFlipAug',
       img_scale=(1333, 800),
       flip=False,
       transforms=[
           dict(type='Resize', keep_ratio=True),
           dict(type='RandomFlip'),
           dict(type='Normalize', mean=[0, 0, 0], std=[1, 1, 1]),
           dict(type='Pad', size_divisor=32),
           dict(type='ImageToTensor', keys=['img']),
           dict(type='Collect', keys=['img']),
       ])
   ]

# manually replace ImageToTensor to DefaultFormatBundle (recommended)
pipelines = [
   dict(type='LoadImageFromFile'),
   dict(
       type='MultiScaleFlipAug',
       img_scale=(1333, 800),
       flip=False,
       transforms=[
           dict(type='Resize', keep_ratio=True),
           dict(type='RandomFlip'),
           dict(type='Normalize', mean=[0, 0, 0], std=[1, 1, 1]),
           dict(type='Pad', size_divisor=32),
           dict(type='DefaultFormatBundle'),
           dict(type='Collect', keys=['img']),
       ])
   ]
```

## Train predefined models on standard datasets

MMDetection also provides out-of-the-box tools for training detection models.
This section will show how to train _predefined_ models (under [configs](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/master/configs)) on standard datasets i.e. COCO.

**Important**: The default learning rate in config files is for 8 GPUs and 2 img/gpu (batch size = 8\*2 = 16).
According to the [linear scaling rule](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02677), you need to set the learning rate proportional to the batch size if you use different GPUs or images per GPU, e.g., `lr=0.01` for 4 GPUs \* 2 imgs/gpu and `lr=0.08` for 16 GPUs \* 4 imgs/gpu.

### Prepare datasets

Training requires preparing datasets too. See section [Prepare datasets](#prepare-datasets) above for details.

**Note**:
Currently, the config files under `configs/cityscapes` use COCO pretrained weights to initialize.
You could download the existing models in advance if the network connection is unavailable or slow. Otherwise, it would cause errors at the beginning of training.

### Training on a single GPU

We provide `tools/train.py` to launch training jobs on a single GPU.
The basic usage is as follows.

```shell
python tools/train.py \
    ${CONFIG_FILE} \
    [optional arguments]
```

During training, log files and checkpoints will be saved to the working directory, which is specified by `work_dir` in the config file or via CLI argument `--work-dir`.

By default, the model is evaluated on the validation set every epoch, the evaluation interval can be specified in the config file as shown below.

```python
# evaluate the model every 12 epoch.
evaluation = dict(interval=12)
```

This tool accepts several optional arguments, including:

- `--no-validate` (**not suggested**): Disable evaluation during training.
- `--work-dir ${WORK_DIR}`: Override the working directory.
- `--resume-from ${CHECKPOINT_FILE}`: Resume from a previous checkpoint file.
- `--options 'Key=value'`: Overrides other settings in the used config.

**Note**:

Difference between `resume-from` and `load-from`:

`resume-from` loads both the model weights and optimizer status, and the epoch is also inherited from the specified checkpoint. It is usually used for resuming the training process that is interrupted accidentally.
`load-from` only loads the model weights and the training epoch starts from 0. It is usually used for finetuning.

### Training on multiple GPUs

We provide `tools/dist_train.sh` to launch training on multiple GPUs.
The basic usage is as follows.

```shell
bash ./tools/dist_train.sh \
    ${CONFIG_FILE} \
    ${GPU_NUM} \
    [optional arguments]
```

Optional arguments remain the same as stated [above](#train-with-a-single-GPU).

#### Launch multiple jobs simultaneously

If you would like to launch multiple jobs on a single machine, e.g., 2 jobs of 4-GPU training on a machine with 8 GPUs,
you need to specify different ports (29500 by default) for each job to avoid communication conflict.

If you use `dist_train.sh` to launch training jobs, you can set the port in commands.

```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 PORT=29500 ./tools/dist_train.sh ${CONFIG_FILE} 4
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=4,5,6,7 PORT=29501 ./tools/dist_train.sh ${CONFIG_FILE} 4
```

### Training on multiple nodes

MMDetection relies on `torch.distributed` package for distributed training.
Thus, as a basic usage, one can launch distributed training via PyTorch's [launch utility](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html#launch-utility).

### Manage jobs with Slurm

[Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) is a good job scheduling system for computing clusters.
On a cluster managed by Slurm, you can use `slurm_train.sh` to spawn training jobs. It supports both single-node and multi-node training.

The basic usage is as follows.

```shell
[GPUS=${GPUS}] ./tools/slurm_train.sh ${PARTITION} ${JOB_NAME} ${CONFIG_FILE} ${WORK_DIR}
```

Below is an example of using 16 GPUs to train Mask R-CNN on a Slurm partition named _dev_, and set the work-dir to some shared file systems.

```shell
GPUS=16 ./tools/slurm_train.sh dev mask_r50_1x configs/mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py /nfs/xxxx/mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x
```

You can check [the source code](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/tools/slurm_train.sh) to review full arguments and environment variables.

When using Slurm, the port option need to be set in one of the following ways:

1. Set the port through `--options`. This is more recommended since it does not change the original configs.

   ```shell
   CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 GPUS=4 ./tools/slurm_train.sh ${PARTITION} ${JOB_NAME} config1.py ${WORK_DIR} --options 'dist_params.port=29500'
   CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=4,5,6,7 GPUS=4 ./tools/slurm_train.sh ${PARTITION} ${JOB_NAME} config2.py ${WORK_DIR} --options 'dist_params.port=29501'
   ```

2. Modify the config files to set different communication ports.

   In `config1.py`, set

   ```python
   dist_params = dict(backend='nccl', port=29500)
   ```

   In `config2.py`, set

   ```python
   dist_params = dict(backend='nccl', port=29501)
   ```

   Then you can launch two jobs with `config1.py` and `config2.py`.

   ```shell
   CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 GPUS=4 ./tools/slurm_train.sh ${PARTITION} ${JOB_NAME} config1.py ${WORK_DIR}
   CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=4,5,6,7 GPUS=4 ./tools/slurm_train.sh ${PARTITION} ${JOB_NAME} config2.py ${WORK_DIR}
   ```
